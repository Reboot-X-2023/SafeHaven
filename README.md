Shelter buddy is a ground breaking cloud native mobile app and website fostering compassion and support within communities by connecting available rooms to homeless individuals in   crisis.  

It offers a seamless and automated solution with three user modes (User, Charity, Host). The User mode allows those in crisis with access to the Internet the ability to create a profile and book a room for the night in the location of their choosing, from a list of matched host rooms based on their preferences.

The Charity Rep mode on the mobile app empowers authorised representatives to facilitate room bookings on-the-go reaching those on the streets who are unaware or unable to access these resources. To provide the best possible service for those in unpredictable circumstances, bookings are flexible and can be arranged at short notice and across multiple locations in the UK. 

Finally, Host mode allows those providing rooms the ability to manage bookings update their profile, and provides a unique features such as arranging scheduled bookings for hosts and clients who have established a strong connection giving the client stability and peace of mind in times of hardship, allowing them to focus on working towards a better life. Uber-style ratings for both hosts and clients promote positive interactions and provide visibility for safety interventions on the charity side. Moreover, if there is high availability on a particular day shelter buddy can also automatically create social media advertising extending to those in other areas of need preventing any room from going unused. This strategic outreach ensures maximum visibility and participation leaving no one in crisis without a safe haven.

Imagine Sarah, a young women, driven to the streets from an abusive home, she urgently needs a safe space to escape but has nowhere to turn. With Shelter Buddy, a room can be booked quickly using a Uber-style ratings and matched host profiles (e.g. DBS checked only) to ensure she connects with a reliable and supportive host offering not just a room but a refuge. 

Data is key for Shelter Buddy and a comprehensive Power BI dashboard empowers charities to analyse data from the app to evaluate the success of the initiative and identifying areas for improvement such as evaluating locations with the most demand, where more hosts would ease demand.
